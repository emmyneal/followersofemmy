We believe we are right on the cusp of finding them. However, this is where we have reached a dilemma. We, Followers of Emmy, need Your help, humble reader. Our next steps will require significant amounts of help from the community, or else we fear We will never find the remains. as for right now, We cannot say much in fear of interception(s) from other organizations. for right now, We need to gather information from the community in regards to Emmy. if You, humble reader, are interested in furthering our cause, please complete the form linked below. </font></center>
