	<center><font size="5">the body of emmy has been buried. seven feet below the surface of our soil. We have spent countless hours trying to locate the remains. We believe that it is our right as the Followers of Emmy to regain control of these remains. it is not fair that they must be hidden away, below the dirt. with all of this being said, the Followers of Emmy have begun working on a campaign to find these remains. We believe we are right on the cusp of finding them. However, this is where we have reached a dilemma. We, Followers of Emmy, need Your help, humble reader. Our next steps will require significant amounts of help from the community, or else we fear We will never find the remains. as for right now, We cannot say much in fear of interception(s) from other organizations. for right now, We need to gather information from the community in regards to Emmy. if You, humble reader, are interested in furthering our cause, please complete the form linked below. </font></center>
