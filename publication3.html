		<br><i>WHY DOES EMMY WEAR A BANDANA? IS THIS AN INDICATION OF CULT LIKE ACTIVITY? I think yes!</i></br>

	</br><i>Emmy always wearing a head covering is weird behavior….</i></br>

<br><i>Always knew that bitch was hiding something under those bandanas….</i></br>

<br><i>As soon as Emmy dies all these weirdos come out the woodwork. Why am I not surprised…. The bandana should’ve been the first red flag. </i></br>

<br>ADDRESSING THE BANDANA CONCERNS:</br>
<br>yes, Emmy wore a bandana. yes, Followers of Emmy observe this and also wear bandanas. but not in any “cult-like” way. this is our way of showing gratitude towards Emmy, and aligning ourselves with the same practices they did. Emmy provided us with not only support and love, but the promise of artistic success. we simply dawn the bandana as a symbol of respect and appreciation for their givings to us. </br>
